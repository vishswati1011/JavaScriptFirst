When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.

Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:
Example :username = John Doe
